# Gee_digitization
The repo describes about how to collect the machine learning datasets for landslide detection
This time i have exported the .tiff file for training purpose 
The problem while exporting the datasets is the machine learning module requires the size of 256*256 but the exported image has size different from it 
At first run the digiytization code and then after run the sampling 
Export the datasets in google drive
